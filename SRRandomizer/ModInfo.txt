Note: This is an early release. It is unpolished and may have bugs.

Randomizer settings can only be changed on the Main Menu.

The game currently unrandomizes each time you close it.

Version 0.3
- Added plort statue randomization

- Food shot into a garden no longer changes to a different type of food (but there's a new setting that preserves this behavior, off by default)
- Slimes spawned by firestorms now affected by slime randomization
